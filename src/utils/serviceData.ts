To counter that problem, the rise of the circular economy concept came about to help in the sustainable growth of businesses.Through our circular economy solutions, we plan and design innovative strategies to provide sustainable solutions to businesses. The kabadiwala’s formulated strategies deal with the 360-degree approach to transforming a linear waste economy into a circular one. By providing end-to-end waste management solutions based on the principles of circular economy, the products in its end of life stage are pushed back into the economy by practising the phenomenon of reusing, repairing, remanufacturing, and recycling existing materials and products.The Kabadiwala’s cutting-edge technological support and analytics tools help in achieving scalability and streamlining the whole process. While for the on-ground operations like dismantling we have The Kabadiwala’s executives, and for the collection and recovery of resources from different sources our The Kabadiwala collection team in partnership with the informal sector carries out the process to maximise the collection as well as recovery. The informal sector including the waste pickers and small scrap dealers are provided with the proper training to impart the skills required. Thus, promoting social inclusion in the informal sector.",

This helps us secure confidentiality, plus encourage hassle-free transportation of the pulp to the recycling facility, and aid a more consistent and eco-friendly recycling.Apart from the documents, The Kabadiwala also takes care of the packaging materials and hoardings; the flag bearer of a brand’s identity and reputation, which need to be securely disposed of as well.The raw material acquired in the shredding process can be re-introduced into our manufacturing cycle, thus helping in the reduction of over harvesting of the natural resources as well as of our imports.",

        "text1": "Older vehicles pose a huge risk to road safety, have higher fuel consumption & contribute to the environment pollution immensely. In line with the sustainable economic development vision of hon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Govt. of India announced the Voluntarily Vehicle Fleet Modernization Program (VVMP) popularly known as Vehicle Scrappage Policy of 2021, it presents a win-win situation for all stakeholders, be it the vehicle owners, pedestrians, automotive industries or the Government.As per the policy, vehicles as old as 10 to 15 years or those who have to be applied for re-registration would be declared as end of life or unfit to be on roads if failed the automated fitness test by the authority. Such vehicles have to be considered for voluntary scrapping by the owners. This is the point where The Kabadiwala’s vehicle scrapping service comes into picture. On depositing the vehicle for scrapping with us, the vehicle owner first of all gets the fair scrap value and a tradable certificate of deposit which can be used to avail multiple benefits such as registration fee waiver, road tax concession and auto OEM discounts on purchase of new vehicle.The kabadiwala with its vehicle scrapping service contributes in formalising the informal sector, and promotes safe & eco-friendly disposal of vehicle scraps after the proper dismantling of the vehicles. This results in the increased availability of low cost materials for automotive, steel & electronics industries by exercising reuse & recycling, and reduced waste going to the landfills. Apart from that, jobs are also created in the currently regarded informal sector as well as in the automotive industries due to increased automotive sales by continuous scrapping of old vehicles. Hence a circular economy will be achieved helping India to become Atma Nirbhar.",
